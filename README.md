## About The Project
This project focuses on the classification of radar echoes over leads and sea ice using machine learning methodologies. The objective is to generate representative echo profiles, analyze their standard deviations, and assess classification accuracy using a confusion matrix by comparing results with the European Space Agency (ESA) official dataset.
